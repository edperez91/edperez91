My name is Edgar Perez. I graduated from EWU with a bachelors in visual communications and design and a certificate in user experience. Highly skilled in Adobe Creative Suite. I have experience working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also have a passion for prototyping and problem solving issues that can help people. I am very detail oriented and enjoy every process of designing from sketching to the final product. I am very adaptive and can pick up new tools quickly that will assist me in designing the best product for my clients.
